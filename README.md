# Let's Cook!

A recipe search mobile app.

## Development

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [Expo Go](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) to start development.

To start the npm server, run:

```bash
cd app
npm start
```

If you are using the Expo Go **mobile app**, scan the QR code.

If you want to use the **web version**, type "w" in the server terminal to show instructions on how to install and use the web version.

## Observations

If the app doesn't load because of a module error:

**"expo-linear-gradient"**:

```bash
npx expo install expo-linear-gradient
```

**"react-native-screens"**:

```bash
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```
